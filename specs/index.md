## Project Overview

**Coffee Tracker** is a personal brewing experiment tracker.

### Goals
- **Experiment Tracking**: Capture brewing parameters and taste outcomes
- **Coffee Library**: Maintain bean metadata independent from experiments
- **Pattern Discovery**: Reveal relationships between variables and outcomes
- **Knowledge Codification**: Record effect mappings (cause→effect relationships)
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Suggest improvements based on score gaps and effect mappings

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Go with chi router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (cloud-hosted)
- **Auth**: Email/password + JWT

### Architecture Principles
- Separation of concerns: Coffee metadata independent from experiments
- Progressive detail: Only coffee reference and notes required; others optional
- Calculated fields: Derive values where possible (days off roast, etc.)
- User defaults: Allow setting defaults for optional fields
- Manual mappings only: No automated inference; users define effect mappings explicitly

### Data Model
```
Coffee (metadata) 1:N ← Experiment (brew record + target profile)
                              ↓ gaps computed
                        Effect Mappings (cause→effect)
                              ↓ matched by
                        Recommendations
```

## Specification Structure

This project uses a **foundations + features** structure designed for AI-assisted development:

- **Foundations**: Cross-cutting conventions (read once, apply everywhere)
- **Features**: Self-contained specs with entity + API + UI in one document

Each feature spec can be read in isolation to understand and implement that feature.

---

## Foundations

Conventions and patterns used across all features. Read these first.

| Spec | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [api-conventions.md](foundations/api-conventions.md) | REST patterns, errors, pagination, filtering |
| [database-conventions.md](foundations/database-conventions.md) | Schema patterns, types, migrations |
| [design-system.md](foundations/design-system.md) | UI patterns, colors, typography, components |

---

## Features

Self-contained feature specifications. Each includes entity definitions, API endpoints, and UI specs.

### Completion Summary

| Status | Count | Features |
|--------|-------|----------|
| ✅ Complete | 8 | authentication, coffee-library, brew-tracking, reference-data, effect-mappings, brew-optimization, recommendations, experiment-review |

**Overall Progress: 8/8 features (100%)**

### Feature Details

| Spec | Status | Dependencies | Purpose |

### Dependency Graph

    │       └── brew-tracking ←── reference-data

    │
    ├── reference-data (filter papers + mineral profiles)
    │
    └── effect-mappings
```

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **reference-data** — Filter papers + mineral profiles, needed by brew-tracking form
2. **effect-mappings** — Independent entity, needed by recommendations and experiment-review
3. **brew-optimization** — Adds target profiles to experiments, enables gap analysis
4. **experiment-review** — List/compare/analyze experiments, manage effect mappings, correlation analysis
5. **recommendations** — Connect gaps to effect mappings for suggestions

## Reading Guide

**For implementing a feature:**
1. Read the relevant foundations specs (api-conventions, database-conventions, design-system)
2. Read the feature spec for full context (entity, API, UI in one place)
3. Check dependencies and ensure prerequisite features are complete
4. Implement

**For AI agents:**
- Each feature spec is self-contained
- No need to read domain/ or system/ directories (they no longer exist)
- Foundations provide shared conventions referenced by all features
